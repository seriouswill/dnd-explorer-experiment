# Pseudocode for Objective Three: Displaying Damage Data and Effectiveness Metrics

# Real-time Data Consumption with PySpark (optional):

# 1. Set up PySpark to continuously query from the PostgreSQL database.
#    - Use PySpark's DataFrame capabilities to read data.

# 2. Calculate Metrics:
#    - Determine percentage of effective hero attacks.
#    - Calculate damage reduced by country.
#    - Calculate total damage globally.

# Visualization with Voila or Plotly Dash:

# 3. Set up the structure of the dashboard.
#    - If using Voila, utilize Jupyter widgets for building interactive components.
#    - If using Plotly Dash, set up app layout with built-in Dash components.

# 4. Display data visualizations:
#    - Damage maps, hero effectiveness pie charts, damage distribution bar charts.

# 5. Refresh Mechanism:
#    - Implement auto-refresh for the dashboard to update visualizations in near-real-time.

# TODO: Implement real-time data consumption.
# TODO: Implement metrics calculations.
# TODO: Set up the dashboard and data visualizations.
# TODO: Implement the refresh mechanism.

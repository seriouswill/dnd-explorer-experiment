# Starter Pseudocode for Objective Two: Data Storage and Damage Determination

# Setup Database:

# 1. Connect to PostgreSQL Database.
#    - Use psycopg2 or SQLAlchemy to establish a connection.

# 2. Initialize tables for storing damage details.
#    - monster_damage: To store data related to damage by monsters.
#    - hero_damage: To store data regarding damage inflicted by heroes.
#    - battle_outcome: To summarize the results of a hero-monster encounter.

# Consumer for 'monster-damage' and 'hero-damage' Topics with PySpark (optional):

# 2. Data Insertion Logic:
#    - As PySpark consumes data, transform them into DataFrames.
#    - Use PySpark's JDBC functionalities to insert data into PostgreSQL tables.

# 3. Determine Monster Defeat:
#    - Analyze data from monster_damage and hero_damage tables.
#    - Use PySpark's DataFrame operations to determine if a monster was defeated.
#    - Update the battle_outcome table with results.

Certainly! Below is a detailed set of requirements, objectives, and steps:

**Hero Generator System - Requirements and Objectives**

**1. Requirements:**

- **Kafka:** For real-time streaming of `monster-damage` and `hero-damage`.
  
- **PostgreSQL:** For storing the results of the hero and monster encounters.

- **Python:** For creating the hero generator, the Kafka consumers, and interactions with the PostgreSQL database.

**2. Objectives:**

- **Real-time Consumption:** Use Kafka to consume `monster-damage` in real-time and dynamically choose the best hero to combat the monster.

- **Hero Selection Logic:** Based on a set of predefined rules, the system should automatically determine which hero is best suited to combat the incoming monster.

- **Combat Results:** Determine the damage caused by the monster, the reduced damage after the hero's intervention, and the monster's remaining health.

- **Data Storage:** Store each combat result in a PostgreSQL database, including the original damage, the reduced damage, hero involved, and whether the monster was eliminated.

**Steps for Implementation:**

1. **Database Setup:**

    - Set up a PostgreSQL database.
    
    - Create a table named `combat_results` with the following columns:
      - `id` (Primary Key)
      - `monster_name`
      - `original_damage`
      - `reduced_damage`
      - `hero_name`
      - `monster_remaining_health`
      - `monster_eliminated` (Boolean)
      - `timestamp` 

2. **Kafka Consumer Development:**

    - Implement a Kafka consumer that subscribes to the `monster-damage` topic.
    
    - For each incoming monster damage message, invoke the hero selection and combat logic.

    - After determining the combat result, produce a new message to the `hero-damage` topic with details about the hero's actions and the damage reduction.

3. **Hero Selection Logic:**

    - Automatically choose a hero based on the monster's characteristics and continent of origin.
    
    - Implement combat calculations based on the chosen hero's specialty and the continent's modifier.

4. **Database Integration:**

    - After determining the combat result, insert a new record into the `combat_results` table in the PostgreSQL database. This record should include all the relevant details of the combat (e.g., monster name, original damage, reduced damage, etc.).

5. **Evaluation Metrics:**

    - Users should be able to query the database to get insights into the hero's effectiveness. For example:
      - Which hero has the highest monster elimination rate?
      - What is the average damage reduction for each hero?
      - How many monsters were eliminated in total?

6. **Error Handling and Monitoring:**

    - Ensure proper error handling for any failures related to Kafka message consumption, database insertions, or any unexpected issues in the combat logic.
    
    - Implement monitoring to track the flow of messages and any anomalies.
